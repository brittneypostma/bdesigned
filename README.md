Hi, I'm Brittney, owner, designer, and developer at [b.Designed](https://bdesigned.netlify.app/). This is my new portfolio site I will be working on. I am a mentor for the [Zero to Mastery Academy](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/?affcode=441520_gjue7n-1), home to over 200k students learning to code. I started teaching myself to code at the end of 2018 while I was a stay at home mom to my 3 wonderful children. I currently mentor students, do live streams on our discord server, tutorial videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyvOaBoW3Jti69U4Gw1ci9Q?view_as=subscriber), and write posts on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/bdesigned) and my digital garden [Console Logs](https://console-logs.netlify.app/). You can find out more about me at [b.Designed](https://bdesigned.netlify.app/).
